Minimal text, focus on visual flow. Arrows connect the actual thumbnail images, not boxes. Clean line drawings with medium-gray tones (#4A5568 to #64748B range). Accent colors: vibrant blue (#3B82F6) and purple (#8B5CF6) that pop on both light and dark backgrounds. Neutral light-gray background (#F1F5F9) with subtle transparency feel. Modern, simple, 2:1 landscape format for GitHub README that displays well on both light and dark theme.
