Main content - Workflow infographic showing SAME CHARACTER evolving through steps:

Step 1: GENERATE
[Icon: sparkle/wand] → [Pixel art character: simple warrior in red tunic]
Arrow with label 'Text → Image'

Step 2: EDIT  
[SAME warrior from step 1] + [Icon: brush/pencil] → [SAME warrior now with armor and sword added]
Arrow with label 'Refine with instructions'

Step 3: COMPOSE
[SAME armored warrior from step 2] + [background elements: tree, chest] + [Icon: layers] → [SAME warrior in forest scene with tree and chest]
Arrow with label 'Combine references'

CRITICAL: The character must be visually identical across all steps, only gaining armor in step 2 and being placed in scene in step 3. Show clear visual continuity.

Horizontal flow with blue arrows. Each step in subtle rounded box.

Bottom: 'Preserve visual features across views, poses, and compositions'
