## Prompt

Keep the same composition and layout. Add stylish light gray rounded rectangle backgrounds only behind each of the three blocks (GENERATE, EDIT, COMPOSE sections). Each background should be a subtle card-like element with soft rounded corners, containing just that stage's label and tree illustration. Leave the white space between blocks and arrows clean. Modern, minimal card design.
