## Prompt

Workflow diagram showing three stages. Horizontal layout. No text labels. White background. Light and appealing visual style.

Stage 1 - Generate:
Three different colored sparkle icons (blue, pink, green)
Arrows pointing to three pixel art images: warrior character, sword weapon, forest background

Stage 2 - Refine:
Each of the three images has a circular loop arrow around it showing iteration
Loop outputs: enhanced warrior with armor, enhanced sword with effects, enhanced forest with atmosphere

Stage 3 - Compose:
Three arrows from the enhanced images converging into one final image
Final image: complete scene combining all three elements - armored warrior holding enhanced sword in atmospheric forest

Essential structure: sparkles → initial images → refinement loops → enhanced images → converge → final combined image

Design this with light, appealing, modern style. White background. Make it visually interesting and clear.
